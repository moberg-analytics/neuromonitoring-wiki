# Signals and Sampling in Continuous Neuromonitoring

## 1. Overview

In continuous neuromonitoring, **signals** are time-varying representations of physiologic processes (e.g., pressure, voltage, flow), and **sampling** is the process by which these continuous phenomena are converted into discrete digital data.

Key ideas:

* Physiologic processes are **continuous in time and amplitude**
* Clinical systems store and analyze **discrete digital representations**
* Sampling decisions determine **what information is preserved, distorted, or lost**
* Many downstream analytics implicitly assume specific sampling properties

Understanding how signals are generated and sampled is essential for correct interpretation, reproducibility, and comparison across systems.

## 2. From Physiology to Digital Signal

### 2.1 Physiologic Sources

Common neuromonitoring signals originate from different physical phenomena:

* **Intracranial pressure (ICP)**: Mechanical pressure within the cranial vault
* **Arterial blood pressure (ABP)**: Pulsatile hydraulic pressure generated by cardiac output
* **Electroencephalography (EEG)**: Electrical potentials from synchronized neuronal activity
* **Cerebral oximetry (e.g., NIRS)**: Optical absorption related to hemoglobin oxygenation
* **Blood flow velocity (e.g., TCD)**: Doppler frequency shifts from moving red blood cells

Each modality reflects a **proxy** of underlying physiology rather than physiology itself.

### 2.2 Sensors and Transducers

Sensors convert physiologic phenomena into analog electrical signals:

* **Strain gauges / piezoresistive sensors** (ICP, ABP)
* **Electrodes** (EEG, ECoG)
* **Photodiodes and light sources** (NIRS)
* **Ultrasound transducers** (TCD)

Important distinctions:

* Sensors have **frequency responses**, noise floors, and nonlinearities
* The sensor often limits fidelity *before* digital sampling occurs

### 2.3 Analog-to-Digital Conversion (High Level)

Digitization typically involves:

1. **Analog conditioning**

   * Amplification
   * Analog filtering (anti-aliasing)
2. **Sampling**

   * Measurement at discrete time intervals
3. **Quantization**

   * Mapping continuous amplitudes to finite digital values

Once digitized, the signal is no longer continuous—even if displayed as such.

## 3. Sampling Rate and Resolution

### 3.1 Sampling Rate

The **sampling rate** defines how frequently a signal is measured (Hz).

Typical ranges (illustrative, system-dependent):

| Modality            | Common Sampling Ranges      |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| ICP waveform        | 50–400 Hz                   |
| ABP waveform        | 100–500 Hz                  |
| EEG                 | 200–2,000+ Hz               |
| Derived ICP metrics | 0.1–1 Hz                    |
| Vital sign trends   | 0.016–1 Hz (1–60 s updates) |

### 3.2 Consequences of Undersampling

* Loss of high-frequency content
* Aliasing (high frequencies appear as low frequencies)
* Distortion of waveform morphology
* Bias in derived metrics relying on timing or pulsatility

### 3.3 Oversampling Considerations

* Increased data volume and storage burden
* Diminishing returns once sensor bandwidth is exceeded
* False sense of precision without additional physiologic information

### 3.4 Bit Depth and Resolution

**Resolution** refers to amplitude precision:

* Common ranges: 12-bit to 24-bit
* Limited by:

  * ADC bit depth
  * Amplifier noise
  * Sensor stability

Higher resolution does not guarantee higher accuracy.

## 4. Filtering and Pre-processing

### 4.1 Common Filters

* **Low-pass filters**: Remove high-frequency noise
* **High-pass filters**: Remove drift or baseline wander
* **Band-pass filters**: Isolate frequency bands (e.g., EEG rhythms)
* **Notch filters**: Suppress power-line interference

Filtering occurs at multiple stages:

* Sensor hardware
* Bedside monitor firmware
* Downstream analytics pipelines

### 4.2 Intended Benefits

* Noise suppression
* Improved visual interpretability
* Reduced artifact sensitivity

### 4.3 Unintended Side Effects

* Phase distortion
* Attenuation of physiologic features
* Artificial smoothing of variability
* Algorithm-dependent bias

Filtering choices directly affect what appears to be “physiology.”

## 5. Waveforms vs Trends

Both waveform data and trended data are important in neurocritical care. 

### 5.1 Waveform Data

* High-frequency, high-fidelity representations
* Preserve morphology, timing, and variability
* Enable retrospective re-analysis

Examples:

* Raw ICP waveform
* Beat-to-beat ABP waveform
* EEG time series

### 5.2 Trended / Derived Data

* Aggregated summaries over time windows
* Reduced temporal resolution
* Often irreversible transformations

Examples:

* Mean ICP every minute
* PRx calculated every 5 minutes
* Spectral EEG power bands

### 5.3 Information Loss

Aggregation discards:

* Beat-level variability
* Transient events
* Precise temporal relationships

Trends are **interpretive abstractions**, not raw measurements.

## 6. Time Alignment and Synchronization

Time alignment and synchronization is critical when collecting data from multiple devices simultaneously. The following topics make accomplishing this non-trivial. 

### 6.1 Clock Drift and Timestamping

* Independent devices maintain separate clocks
* Drift accumulates over hours to days
* Timestamps may reflect:

  * Acquisition time
  * Transmission time
  * Storage time

### 6.2 Cross-Device Alignment

Challenges include:

* Different sampling rates
* Buffered or batched data
* Network latency
* Resampling during integration

### 6.3 Why Misalignment Matters

* Cross-modal metrics (e.g., pressure-flow relationships)
* Event attribution
* Causal inference
* Validation of derived analytics

Small timing errors can produce large analytic differences. Fortunately, several medical devices and software systems (e.g., MCP, ICM+, CNS Monitor) have been designed to catch and correct these errors.

## 7. Sampling-Related Artefacts and Pitfalls

### 7.1 Aliasing

* Occurs when sampling below twice the signal bandwidth
* Produces misleading low-frequency patterns

### 7.2 Quantization Noise

* Finite amplitude resolution introduces noise
* More visible in low-amplitude or slowly varying signals

### 7.3 Dropouts and Interpolation

* Missing data due to:

  * Sensor disconnects
  * Network interruptions
* Interpolation may mask true absence of signal

### 7.4 Resampling Errors

* Up-sampling does not recreate lost information
* Down-sampling without proper filtering introduces distortion

## 8. Implications for Derived Analytics

Derived metrics depend strongly on sampling assumptions:

* **PRx**: Sensitive to low-frequency content and windowing
* **CPPopt**: Influenced by averaging, alignment, and resampling
* **EEG displays**: Affected by filter settings and montage choices

Identical algorithms may yield different outputs across datasets due solely to sampling and preprocessing differences.

## 9. Key Takeaways

* Physiologic signals are continuous; digital data are not
* Sampling choices shape interpretation as much as algorithms
* Waveforms and trends answer fundamentally different questions
* Filtering and aggregation always involve trade-offs
* Cross-system comparisons require explicit attention to sampling
